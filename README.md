Create your first Image Recognition Classifier using CNN, Keras and Tensorflow backend

With the dawn of a new era of A.I., machine learning, and robotics, its time for the machines to perform tasks characteristic of human intelligence. Machines use their own senses to do things like planning, pattern recognizing, understanding natural language, learning and solving problems. And Image Recognition is one of its senses!!!

From Automated self-driven cars to Boosting augmented reality applications and gaming, from Image and Face Recognition on Social Networks to Its application in various Medical fields, Image Recognition has emerged as a powerful tool and has become a vital for many upcoming inventions.
